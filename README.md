# Hello everybody. :grinning:
## Welcome to my profile.

I am Elisabeth. I live in the south of Hamburg and am currently taking part in a web development bootcamp. I'm looking forward to working as a front-end developer soon.

What I like to do when I'm not programming:
- :game_die: play with my children
- :bike: being outside, e.g. on bike tours
- :earth_africa: learn languages
- :cook: cook
- :guitar: Listen to music or go to concerts
- :book: read
- :coffee: drink coffee

I look forward to getting to know you and getting started together! :rocket:
